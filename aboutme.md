**Work:** Since February 2018, I have been working as a consultant for the Federal Government specializing in cyber analytics and machine learning. Prior to that, I worked at Booz Allen Hamilton as a Software Engineer/Data Scientist supporting the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency](https://www.nga.mil/Pages/Default.aspx)

**Education:**

**Hobbies:**

My name is Inigo Montoya. I have the following qualities:

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
